# Final Project

This is it!
No reading, no contrived exercises.
Let's ship something.

The final project can scale from a small CLI to a distributet architecture, depending on what you want to do and how far you get.
Whatever that is, you'll get there in small steps and with all the help you need.

To start off, pick one of the available components to implement first.
If you can't decide, start with the CLI!

- clients
  - [ ] [CLI](cli.md)
  - [ ] [Python module](py_module.md)
- GUI-clients
  - [ ] [web app](web.md)
  - [ ] [TUI](tui.md)
  - [ ] [native GUI](native_gui.md)
- server
  - [ ] [HTTP/REST-API](http.md) (recommended as your first server)
  - [ ] [websocket](websocket.md) (actually an extension of the HTTP server)
  - [ ] [gRPC](grpc.md) (more advanced server architecture)
